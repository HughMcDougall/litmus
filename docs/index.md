<u>**L**ag **I**nference **T**hrough the **M**ixed **U**se of **S**amplers</u>

LITMUS is an in-progress program that uses modern statistical techniques, like nested sampling and stochastic variational inference, in combination with cutting edge programming tools like the just-in-time compilation framework
`jax` and its bayesian modelling package
`NumPyro`, to perform the messy task of lag recovery in AGN reverberation mapping.

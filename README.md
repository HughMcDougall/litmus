# LITMUS

**L**ag **I**nference **T**hrough the **M**ixed **U**se of **S**amplers

LITMUS is an in-progress program that uses modern statistical techniques, like nested sampling and stochastic variational inference, in combination with cutting edge programming tools like the just-in-time compilation framework `jax` and its bayesian modelling package `NumPyro`, to perform the messy task of lag recovery in AGN reverberation mapping.

This project is still very much in the early stages. If you have any questions, contact the author directly at hughmcdougallemail@gmail.com
